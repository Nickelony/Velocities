<b>A simple plugin that adds custom velocity settings such as 'sm_bonusvelocity', 'sm_velocity_multiplier' and more.</b><br>
The main purpose of this plugin is to share some amazing velocity functions, which you can use in your plugins or directly on your server.

If you're going to use this plugin on your server, please keep in mind that it only affects the horizontal velocity, unless you change it in the code.
